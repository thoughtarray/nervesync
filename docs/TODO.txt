Don't restart nerve if a service that doesn't have a definition is found
Nerve needs to watcher multiple environments

Change zookeeper to this
/env/{env}/sd/[services]
So that nerve-sync can "pickup" a new environment dynamically

Make logging configurable
Old logging stuff
#logger = logging.getLogger('nerve-sync')
#logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
# logfile = logging.FileHandler('nervepoke.log')
# LOG.addHandler(logfile)
#handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
#formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
#handler.setFormatter(formatter)
#logger.addHandler(handler)

Enable config file reads?
sync retry logic

***Getting host ip: we need it to put the address in ZK via nerve.  I can't figure out how to get this; so we will rely
    on the ec2metadata service for now D:
